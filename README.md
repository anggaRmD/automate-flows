# My Automate Flows

Flows I created for Automate app.

## [Auto ADB Mode](https://github.com/rahaaatul/automate-flows/tree/main/Auto%20ADB%20Mode)

> [!NOTE]
> This flow automatically activate wireless debugging and set ADB over TCP/IP port 5555, allowing you to continue using your device seamlessly without manual reconfiguration after every restart.
> Also has another flow to start Shizuku too.
